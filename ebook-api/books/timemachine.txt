I remember with perfect clarity the morning when the old seafaring man first crossed the threshold of my father’s inn. The Admiral Benbow stood lonely upon the cliffs, facing the restless grey waters of the western sea, and travellers were rare in those days. Yet this stranger, tall and broad-shouldered, with a weather-beaten coat and a plaited queue falling upon his back, strode in as though the place belonged to him.

He cast upon the table a heavy seaman’s chest, scarred by many voyages, and demanded rum in a voice so harsh and deep that it seemed shaped by storms. My father, timid by nature, complied at once, while I lingered in the doorway, observing the man with a mixture of fear and fascination. His left cheek bore a jagged scar, and from time to time he would lift a battered brass telescope to the window, as though expecting pursuers.

“Boy,” he said abruptly, fixing me with a stern eye, “keep watch for a man with one leg. Should he come near this inn, you tell me at once. There’ll be a silver penny in it for you.”

The request struck me as peculiar, but there was something in his look that forbade refusal. For weeks thereafter the stranger—he called himself the Captain, though whether truthfully I cannot say—took up lodging with us, pacing the cliffs by day and drinking himself into a fierce, brooding silence each night. When he did speak, it was always of distant seas, mutinous crews, and buried plunder.

It was in the depth of winter that the first hint of danger arrived: a blind beggar, gaunt and terrible, tapping his stick along the frozen road. He asked for the Captain by name. The moment their hands met, the beggar pressed into the Captain’s palm a small parchment—“the black spot,” as I later learned—an ominous summons from his former shipmates. The Captain turned ashen, and before the hour was out, he fell dead of apoplexy in our common room.

My mother and I, trembling yet resolute, broke open his sea chest in hopes of recovering the overdue lodging fees. But within we found not only coins and seafarer’s trinkets, but a map—thick, brittle parchment showing an island shaped like a bent dagger, with anchorage notes, bearings, and a great red cross marking the “bulk of treasure here.” Never had my heart beat so wildly.

Before dawn, word of the Captain’s death spread along the road, and shadowy figures gathered upon the cliff path. Realising the peril, I fled with the map tucked beneath my coat, determined to deliver it into safe hands. Little did I know that this single sheet of parchment would soon draw me into a voyage of treachery, storms, and adventure beyond anything I had ever dreamed, and that the name Treasure Island would forever haunt my imagination.
